================================================================================
Version 2.1.3 May 2014
	Patch release
	
	*BEAST template fixed

	add AppStore for conveniently launching applications from packages

	improved FASTA support

	a few small fixes (BEAUti displays of log normal, monophyletic constraint logging, allow import of alignments with same name in BEAUti,etc.)


Version 2.1.2 April 2014

	Patch release

	BEAUti handles multiple partitions more conveniently

	improved package management

	fix bug in *BEAST template
	
	many small fixes (FASTA support, stochastic distributions, *BEAST operator weighting, etc.)


Version 2.1.1 January 2014
	
	Patch release speeding up BEAUti to handle large Nexus files and handle multiple files.


Version 2.1.0 December 2013

	Support for many more packages, including 
		o CladeAge for fossil calibrations
		o Sampled Ancestor Trees
		o Multi Type Trees for structured coalescent
		o Birth-Death SIR model
    If not already available these will be so soon.

	Support for JSON file format

	Beagle update issue resolved -- no more incorrectly calculated likelihoods

	Core refactored, for ease of developing packages

	*BEAST start state for getting faster through burn-in

	BEAUti many small fixes supporting more packages

	DensiTree and TreeAnnotator updated



Version 2.0.2 February 2013

	Beagle scale issue resolved, resulting in potentially faster 
	treelikelihood calculations

	Treeannotator and logcombiner updated to version 2
	
	BEAUti - use-ambiguities flag in partition panel

	colt and apache math-commons libraries included so not all add-ons
	need to supply them separately

	Support for path-sampling through beastii add-on



Version 2.0.c released on 1st December 2011

	New Features:
	
    Allows resuming an MCMC chain. Handy when the chain turns out to
    converge slower than expected.

    Real time tracking of ESSs while running a chain.

    Beauti allows reloading files, so that small changes do not require any
    XML editing.

    For developers, code is better documented, and only the most relevant
    classes are part of Beast 2 (i.e. no experimental research code), making
    it easier to learn.

    Easily extendible: for example, the BeastII add-on supports multi chain
    MCMC, some experimental likelihood calculations that are potentially
    faster than the base implementation, and a spread sheet GUI for
    manipulating models.
